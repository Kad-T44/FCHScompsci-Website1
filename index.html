    <h1 style="text-align:center;">A Rant Regarding MusiCorp</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">(Also known as me ranting about the corporation responsible for the death of Vaporwave)</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">(This is all in good jest, pretty sure musicorp doesnt even exist)</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">There are many problems with MusiCorp's diegeses. The one that's the most blatant, and the one that I will limit my discussion to, is related to its overt support of vigilantism. Before I launch into my rant, permit me the prelude caveat that even if one isn't completely conversant with current events, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that it has been brought to my attention that a large percentage of MusiCorp's hatchet men can be termed lubricious. While this is true, MusiCorp's demented treacheries have caused militant ruffians to descend upon us like a swarm of locusts, forcing us to tailor our ploys just to suit its hate-filled whims.

        If MusiCorp succeeds in its attempt to marginalize me based on my gender, race, or religion, it'll have to be over my dead body. MusiCorp has been going around saying that it does the things it does “for the children”. That's a bit of a furphy. The truth is that I recently heard a famous celebrity—I forgot which one—say, “One positive outcome of the Law of Unintended Consequences is that if we stimulate honorable, thoughtful, and practical action then MusiCorp won't be able to inject even more fear and divisiveness into political campaigns.” That's such a great quote, I wish I had been the one who thought of it. Sadly, the cleverest thing I ever said was that MusiCorp frequently insists that it is known for its sound judgment, unerring foresight, and sagacious adaptation of means to ends. This lie of its cannot stand the light of day, and a few minutes' reflection will suffice to show how utterly dotty a lie it is. Nonetheless, argumentative saltimbancos rarely question, resist, or protest those events that do not appear to affect them directly. For example, they ignore how MusiCorp has been toppling society.
        
        MusiCorp's disquisitions are pockmarked with bleeding-heart metagrobolism and other assorted ills. Hence and therefore, it has managed to convince a vast assortment of people that “the norm” shouldn't have to worry about how the exceptions feel. That's just further evidence that the most insidious thing in the world is nonsense that sounds just plausible enough to listen to. It's the sort of nonsense that prevents people from seeing that MusiCorp is unable to separate fact from fiction. For the benefit of any doubting Thomases I will prove that point via an explanation of how MusiCorp's slaphappy, oppressive peons like to shout, “Let's take over society's eyes, ears, mind, and spirit. That'll be wonderful. Hooray, hooray!” But that won't be wonderful. Rather, it'll influence the attitudes of dominant culture towards any environment or activity that is predominantly pathological.
        
        To have the audacity to say that “pharisaical zobs”—and let's be clear that MusiCorp is referring here to its adversaries—are incabable of opposing our human vices wherever they may be found—arrogance, hatred, jealousy, unfaithfulness, avarice, and so on—is, in my opinion, nothing short of disputatious. If you were to ask MusiCorp, it'd say that it doesn't remember carving out space in the mainstream for sanguinary politics. Not only does MusiCorp have a very selective memory, but I, for one, was completely flabbergasted when I first heard that it fully intends to declare that it's above everyone else. I feel sorry for the human race when I hear stuff like that. I keep thinking, “Why can't we just redirect our focus and energy towards peace and prosperity for all people?” I guess the answer is that it will probably never understand why it scares me so much. And MusiCorp does scare me: Its false-flag operations are scary, its imprecations are scary, and most of all, I can't follow its pretzel logic. I do, however, know that MusiCorp occasionally shows what appears to be warmth, joy, love, or compassion. You should realize, however, that these positive expressions are more feigned than experienced and invariably serve an ulterior motive, such as to marginalize the traditions and truths upon which our nation's greatness sits.
        
        My friends, I must say to you that I have a tendency to report the more sensational things that MusiCorp is up to, the more shocking things, things like how it wants to sue people at random. And I realize the difficulty that the average person has in coming to grips with that, but it may be reasonably cunning with words. However, it is absolutely rabid with everything else. By this, I mean that if MusiCorp would abandon its name-calling and false dichotomies it would be much easier for me to live by such noble values as honor, duty, loyalty, and courage. Through adherence to those values one can find meaning and a higher purpose in life and clarity as to why MusiCorp wants us to believe that one day it will be considered cool to lead a villainous jihad against those who oppose MusiCorp. Yes, things will be that way if we choose to believe that. I choose not to believe that. I choose to believe that it is my creed that I shall ever be true in advocating social change through dialogue, passive resistance, and nonviolence, and I will strenuously oppose any compromise thereof in any and all things. Let me end by stating simply that MusiCorp has gotten us into one hell of a mess. I'll leave it at that.</p>
